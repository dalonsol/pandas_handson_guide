# pandas_handson_guide

What we are basically going to do here is use pandas in python in order to manage databases.
The idea is both creating the data and reading it. (pd.DataFrame() and pd.read_x()).

It will go through all the main functions of pandas in a single notebook.

We'll have another directory with the databases used (mainly .csv)

Hope this is helpful for anyone starting to learn both python and pandas.

My advise: it's easy when you practice, is hard when you don't.

Enjoy it :)
